       <p>Carl Sagan was a famous American astronomer and popularizer of science. His incredible life was characterized by a burning curiousity about, and passion for, the universe around him. He was one of the most quintessentially human people to have lived in the 20th century, and his loss in 1996 was a loss for all humanity.</p>
